# Quiz-application

Please make sure you have node js and mongo db installed.
I have used mongodb to store questions along with answers and implemented a restful api.

create a dir and clone the project
 - git clone and the link
 
 - cd into Quiz-application and type npm install...
 - cd into quiz and type npm install
 - cd ..(root folder) and type yarn run dev

please note you have to add atleast two questions to initialize the quiz.

 - server runs on port 5000 and react run on port 3000
